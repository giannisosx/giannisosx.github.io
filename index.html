                            ...late Mr Reginald Lewis of TLC Beatrice,
                            were revealed to have <b>brain cancer</b>. It was not clear, however, that either
                            man was a particularly heavy user of cellular telephones.
                            As health worries escalated this week, the cellular industry tried
                            strenuously, but with limited success, to dispel fears of the
                            electro-magnetic <b>radio waves</b> emitted by the phones.
                            Motorola insisted the safety of its phone was 'rooted in scientific fact',
                            and produced several papers on the effects of <b>radio waves</b> on human and
                            animal.
                            But critics were quick to point out that the evidence advanced by Motorola
                            included only one study...

                        diagnosis, where it has largely supplanted the CAT scan and myelography, a
                        risky and painful procedure that involves injecting dye into the spinal canal
                        and then having X-rays taken.


                        An MRI system consists of a large, tube-shaped magnet in which patients are
                        placed lying down and then bombarded with <b>radio</b> frequency <b>waves</b>. The <b>radio</b>
                        frequency <b>waves</b> that return from the patient's body are translated by computer
                        into anatomical images. Such procedures are not cheap, costing $800 on the
                        average.


                        Hoppszallern also said the applications of MRI technology are likely to be
                        expanded through research.  </p>

                        Dr. Michael C. Weiner, who runs the MRS lab at the VA hospital in San
                        Francisco, is sure that day is rapidly approaching. "This technique allows us
                        to 'see' how the cells are working," says the 48-year-old transplanted New
                        Yorker, "without cutting or needles, without X-rays, without any harmful
                        radiation. Just magnetism and <b>radio waves</b>."


                        Even if it shuns scalpels, Weiner's lab has certainly been on the cutting edge.
                        In close collaboration with the University of California San Francisco Medical
                        Center, it is using MRS to unravel the chemistry of heart attacks, of <b>brain</b> and
